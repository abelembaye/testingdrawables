The high-level {@link Builder.new `Builder.new()`} convenience\n * method creates the specific `Builder` subclass for the supplied `DataType`.\n *\n * Once created, `Builder` instances support both appending values to the end\n * of the `Builder`, and random-access writes to specific indices\n * (`Builder.prototype.append(value)` is a convenience method for\n * `builder.set(builder.length, value)`). Appending or setting values beyond the\n * Builder's current length may cause the builder to grow its underlying buffers\n * or child Builders (if applicable) to accommodate the new values.\n *\n * After enough values have been written to a `Builder`, `Builder.prototype.flush()`\n * will commit the values to the underlying ArrayBuffers (or child Builders). The\n * internal Builder state will be reset, and an instance of `Data<T>` is returned.\n * Alternatively, `Builder.prototype.toVector()` will flush the `Builder` and return\n * an instance of `Vector<T>` instead.\n *\n * When there are no more values to write, use `Builder.prototype.finish()` to\n * finalize the `Builder`. This does not reset the internal state, so it is\n * necessary to call `Builder.prototype.flush()` or `toVector()` one last time\n * if there are still values queued to be flushed.\n *\n * Note: calling `Builder.prototype.finish()` is required when using a `DictionaryBuilder`,\n * because this is when it flushes the values that have been enqueued in its internal\n * dictionary's `Builder`, and creates the `dictionaryVector` for the `Dictionary` `DataType`.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { Builder, Utf8 } from 'apache-arrow';\n *\n * const utf8Builder = Builder.new({\n *     type: new Utf8(),\n *     nullValues: [null, 'n/a']\n * });\n *\n * utf8Builder\n *     .append('hello')\n *     .append('n/a')\n *     .append('world')\n *     .append(null);\n *\n * const utf8Vector = utf8Builder.finish().toVector();\n *\n * console.log(utf8Vector.toJSON());\n * // > [\"hello\", null, \"world\", null]\n * ```\n *\n * @typeparam T The `DataType` of this `Builder`.\n * @typeparam TNull The type(s) of values which will be considered null-value sentinels.\n */\nexport class Builder {\n  /**\n   * Construct a builder with the given Arrow DataType with optional null values,\n   * which will be interpreted as \"null\" when set or appended to the `Builder`.\n   * @param {{ type: T, nullValues?: any[] }} options A `BuilderOptions` object used to create this `Builder`.\n   */\n  constructor(_ref) {\n    let {\n      'type': type,\n      'nullValues': nulls\n    } = _ref;\n    /**\n     * The number of values written to the `Builder` that haven't been flushed yet.\n     * @readonly\n     */\n    this.length = 0;\n    /**\n     * A boolean indicating whether `Builder.prototype.finish()` has been called on this `Builder`.\n     * @readonly\n     */\n    this.finished = false;\n    this.type = type;\n    this.children = [];\n    this.nullValues = nulls;\n    this.stride = strideForType(type);\n    this._nulls = new BitmapBufferBuilder();\n    if (nulls && nulls.length > 0) {\n      this._isValid = createIsValidFunction(nulls);\n    }\n  }\n  /**\n   * Create a `Builder` instance based on the `type` property of the supplied `options` object.\n   * @param {BuilderOptions<T, TNull>} options An object with a required `DataType` instance\n   * and other optional parameters to be passed to the `Builder` subclass for the given `type`.\n   *\n   * @typeparam T The `DataType` of the `Builder` to create.\n   * @typeparam TNull The type(s) of values which will be considered null-value sentinels.\n   * @nocollapse\n   */\n  // @ts-ignore\n  static new(options) {}\n  /** @nocollapse */\n  // @ts-ignore\n  static throughNode(options) {\n    throw new Error(\"\\\"throughNode\\\" not available in this environment\");\n  }\n  /** @nocollapse */\n  // @ts-ignore\n  static throughDOM(options) {\n    throw new Error(\"\\\"throughDOM\\\" not available in this environment\");\n  }\n  /**\n   * Transform a synchronous `Iterable` of arbitrary JavaScript values into a\n   * sequence of Arrow Vector<T> following the chunking semantics defined in\n   * the supplied `options` argument.\n   *\n   * This function returns a function that accepts an `Iterable` of values to\n   * transform.
